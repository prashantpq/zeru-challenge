<!-- # 📝 Wallet Scoring Analysis

## 📌 Overview

This analysis summarizes the scoring of user wallets based on their DeFi transaction data. The pipeline included:

1. **Data Loading** – Reading transaction records from the JSON dataset.
2. **Feature Engineering** – Generating meaningful aggregated features per wallet.
3. **Scoring** – Scaling features and calculating a composite wallet score.

## 🔧 Feature Engineering

The following features were engineered for each wallet:

| Feature Name          | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| `total_deposits_usd`  | Total deposit amount in USD. |
| `total_redeems_usd`   | Total redeemed amount in USD. |
| `txn_count`           | Total transaction count. |
| `unique_assets`       | Number of unique assets interacted with. |
| `max_deposit_usd`     | Maximum deposit amount in USD. |
| `has_liquidation`     | Whether the wallet had any liquidation events (1 or 0). |
| `avg_deposit_usd`     | Average deposit amount in USD. |

## 📈 Scoring Methodology

- **Scaler Used**: `MinMaxScaler` with feature range (0, 1000).
- **Score Calculation**: Mean of scaled features multiplied by 1000, rounded to integer.

## 🗃️ Final Score Summary

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Count** | 3497 wallets |
| **Mean** | ~60.31 |
| **Std** | ~84.61 |
| **Min** | 0 |
| **25%** | 0 |
| **50% (Median)** | 40 |
| **75%** | 81 |
| **Max** | 1000 |

- The top scoring wallet achieved **1000**, indicating dominant DeFi activity relative to peers.

# 📈 Wallet Score Analysis

This analysis provides insights into the **distribution of wallet scores** generated by the credit scoring engine and examines behavioral patterns of wallets in **low vs. high scoring ranges**.

## 🔢 Score Distribution

Below is the distribution of wallet scores across defined ranges:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load scored wallets
scores_df = pd.read_csv('../wallet_scores.csv')  # Adjust path if needed

# Define score bins (0-100, 100-200, ..., 900-1000)
bins = [0,100,200,300,400,500,600,700,800,900,1000]
labels = ['0-100','100-200','200-300','300-400','400-500','500-600','600-700','700-800','800-900','900-1000']
scores_df['score_range'] = pd.cut(scores_df['score'], bins=bins, labels=labels, include_lowest=True)

# Plot distribution
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
scores_df['score_range'].value_counts().sort_index().plot(kind='bar', color='skyblue')
plt.title('Wallet Score Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Score Range')
plt.ylabel('Number of Wallets')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
