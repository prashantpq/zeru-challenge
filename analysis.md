# 📝 Wallet Scoring Analysis

## 📌 Overview

This analysis summarizes the scoring of user wallets based on their DeFi transaction data. The pipeline included:

1. **Data Loading** – Reading transaction records from the JSON dataset.
2. **Feature Engineering** – Generating meaningful aggregated features per wallet.
3. **Scoring** – Scaling features and calculating a composite wallet score.
